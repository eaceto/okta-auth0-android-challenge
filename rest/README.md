# Coffees REST API

This is a simple Express API that serves different coffees.

## Configuration
In order to run this API you need to have installed Node JS. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
# ./rest
npm install
```

Create an API in the Auth0 dashboard selecting _RS256_ as the signing algorithm. You can add the API permissions that you require. Take the API identifier and your account's domain and put them in the `.env` file. 

```go
AUDIENCE={API_IDENTIFIER}
ISSUER_BASE_URL={AUTH0_DOMAIN}
```
**Hint:** The issuer base URL starts with `https://`.

You can read more about APIs in the following articles:

The service will be available in `localhost:3000`.
